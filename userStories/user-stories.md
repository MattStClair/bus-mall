#user stories

#As a developer:
-I want to represent three random images for a user to click on.
-I also want be able to log the number of times a random image is clicked.
-I want a constructor function that creates an object associated with each image

Constraints:
-I also do not want the same three images to populate twice in a row.

-The user can only click 25 times and at the end a list of click amounts is displayed.

#As a user:
-I want a webpage that displays three images for me to click on so that I can get an idea of the types of images I am more interested in purchasing from busMall

#As a BusMall executive:
-I want a website that will clue me in on the habits of customers so I can cater to their wants and make lots of money!!
